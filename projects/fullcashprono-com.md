Fullcashprono is a project I worked on as a freelance developer on the [Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/armandduparclocmaria) platform. The client wanted to be able to sell betting prognostics as a subscription.  

I used VueJS and Vuetify for the front-end, Firebase for the back-end and Stripe to process the payments. It was an interesting project to work on since I had never used VueJS and Firebase before.
