* I built a computer vision pipeline from the ground up. The aim of the project was to detect objects on images taken by an embedded system. I set up labeling tools, trained the model and prepared it's deployment to production. The main challenge was the small size of objects to detect (<16px). The model achieves 88% average precision (0.88 AP@0.5).
