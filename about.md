title: About me

---
I am an engineering student currently studying computer science abroad, in London.  
I like building stuff \[example\] and solving problems\[exemples\].  
I'm an introvert and feel most at ease in calm environments.  
I also enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies by working on professional projects. I find it easier to learn with real deadlines and money on line.
