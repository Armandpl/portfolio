title: About me

---
I am an engineering student currently studying computer science abroad, in London.  
I like building stuff \[example\] and solving problems\[exemples\].  
I'm an introvert and feel most at ease in calm environments \[un peu la def de introvert finalement\].  
I also enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies by working on professional projects \[easier for me to learn w/ real deadlines et argent à la clé\].
