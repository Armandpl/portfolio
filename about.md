title: About me

---
I am an engineering student currently studying computer science in Paris.  
I like building [physical stuff](/projects/jewelry-making.html) and [virtual stuff](/projects/fullcashprono-com.html).  
I feel most at ease in calm environments.  
I also enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies by working on professional projects.
