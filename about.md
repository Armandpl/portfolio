title: About me
---

I am a young french engineer currently studying computer science and electronics abroad, in London.  
I like building stuff [example] and solving problems[exemples].  
I'm an introvert and feel most at ease in calm environments [un peu la def de introvert finalement].  
I also enjoy learning new technical concepts and technologies by working on professional projects [easier for me to learn w/ real deadlines et argent à la clé].
